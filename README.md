# COMP.CS.100 Programming 1: Introduction to programming
This repository contains all assignments I did for my university's 1st programming course. The course was done with Python. I hadn't seriously touched Python before this course, but I did have multiple years of programming experience in other languages.

I'd say everything here is awfully uninteresting, apart from the assignments that were "projects". So essentially they were "harder" and required more work.  
I moved the very last project ([battleships-py](https://github.com/0x464e/battleships-py)) to its own repository, but the other projects ([tulitikkupeli](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-100/tree/master/3), [energiatilasto](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-100/tree/master/6), [ystavaverkko](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-100/tree/master/9) and [accesscontrol](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-100/tree/master/12)) are here along with a screenshot of their assignments.
