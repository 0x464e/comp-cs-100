Project: accesscontrol

A program which controls access to doors via door codes and area access codes.
Door codes and are codes are defined in DOORCODES and unique access cards,
identified by an id, are read from a text file 'accessinfo.txt'.

The program can print info about specific access cards and add access codes
to them.
